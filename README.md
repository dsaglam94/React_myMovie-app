  ## How it's made:
  <strong>Tech used:</strong> ReactJs, TailwindCSS, Firebase & Firestore
  
  I made this project to strengthen my CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) knowledge. Movie app is not one of the most original ideas but it gives you valuable practice opportunities. I love using ReactJs and Firebase together, it gives you so much power. 
  
  ## Lessons Learned:
  
  Creating, updating or reading can be done in server-side but deleting should be done in client-side. So I had to find the right way to implement this to my project. Hopefully, I've come accross with a good article about this situation. 
    
  Overall, this was a tremendous learning experience.
